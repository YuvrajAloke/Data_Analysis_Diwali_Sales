## Introduction

The objective of this project is to analyze sales data collected during the Diwali season. Using this analysis, we can derive insights into the performance of different products, sales patterns, customer segmentation, and other business metrics. This analysis will help in optimizing marketing strategies, product offerings, and customer targeting during future sales periods.

## Project Structure

The repository consists of the following files:

- `Diwali Sales Data.csv`: This file contains raw sales data, including customer demographics, products sold, sales amounts, and other relevant details.
- `Diwali_Sales_Analysis.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook contains the Python code used to process and analyze the data. It includes data cleaning, visualization, and insights generation.

## Data Description

The Diwali sales data contains several fields related to the transactions made during the Diwali season. Some of the key columns include:

- **Customer ID**: Unique identifier for each customer.
- **Product Category**: Category of the product sold.
- **Sales Amount**: Total amount of the transaction.
- **Quantity Sold**: Number of items sold in the transaction.
- **Customer Demographics**: Information about the customer, such as age, gender, location, etc.

## Usage

After opening the notebook, you can execute the cells to perform the analysis.

Key sections in the notebook:
- **Data Cleaning**: Handling missing data and correcting data types.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Visualizing sales trends, customer demographics, and product categories.
- **Insights Generation**: Summarizing key takeaways from the analysis, such as the best-selling products, highest revenue-generating regions, and customer behavior patterns.

## Results

Some of the key insights derived from the analysis include:
- [Insert insights from your analysis here, e.g., "Category X had the highest sales during Diwali."]
- [Insert another key takeaway, e.g., "Customers in Region Y spent the most per transaction."]
